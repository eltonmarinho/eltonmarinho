### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Elton Marinho from BrazilðŸŒŠ (ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡·). I've been working as Software Developer since 2020, I'm currently studing at [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com). I'm passionate about open source projects, so I've created some projects as [Particular](https://github.com/eltonmarinho)

In my free time I like to go hiking (ðŸŒ„), to play the guittar (ðŸŽ¸), and read books (ðŸ“š).

Would you like to find me?
